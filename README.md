# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for programming challenges from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.

## How to Run

To execute any solution, use Node.js with the following command:

```bash
node exercise-*.js
```

For example:
```bash
node exercise-01.js
node exercise-02.js
node exercise-03.js
```
